     * Director is the Controller of Controllers of the organization.
     *
     * - listen/accept request context (buy=post req, sell=get req)
     * - define strategy (define a choice from available alternatives) within the app
     * for result (page, response [product]) and context (market).
     *
     * - permit a procedure by sign. So listen to request and the way of work-flow (process, design-pattern?).
     * For instance using PDO tool permission.
     *
     * - watch/control and create capacity (budget) some time. Lets say every 3 days.
     * But this can be also triggered by a big request. So every new route item (in routes file) should cause
     * checking capacity check. And a new route should be added/removed by the director, not the programmer.
     * Adding/Removing a route item should be caused by the ....
     *
     * - negotiation and contraction with services. Like web services that delivers data but also services
     * those accepts output and delivers to their requests (api client & api server).
     *
     * - market watch. competetions (how much a tool is liked) and opportunities (new package check).
     *
     * - re-orginize workers and managers. (managers(controllers) should not be generated manually, but by the Director?)
     *
     * - periodical analyse by communicating the workers, managers.
     *
     * - represent the app on platforms and making introduction to others (composer image?)
     *
     * - maintain tools by repairing, buying
     *
     * - analyse app prestations by evaluations
     *
     *
     *
     * MODEL : which model to use.
     * - define context
     * - hires a mapper (planner)
     * - delegate (responsibility) Logic to a worker and let it cooperate with mapper
     * The Model that choosed by the director takes care of product (page) data, translations, navigation, logs, etc.
     *
     * TEMPLATE : which template/response to use. A template can be located at external place. front-end development.
     *
     * VIEW : Making model available(connect things) to Response generator (template).
     *
     *
     * @todo Director tasks. Pretty much every class that would normally needed from the \app\core directory.

        /* a research how to structure a model
         * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5863870/how-should-a-model-be-structured-in-mvc
         * (contact this guy and show the github dir)
         *
         * Model = Layer = Organisation of programming into separate functional components
         * that interact in some sequential and hieracrhial way, with each layer usually having an interface only to the layer
         * above it and the layer below it. (interfaces define the connection between the layers).
         * A model can be build of n layers. For example TCP/IP two layers. 1. provide transport 2. provide network adress.
         * Model != Single Class
         * Model != Single Object
         * Model != ORM technique
         * Model != abstraction of db tables
         *
         *
         * 1. Domain Object(s) `structures/layers`
         * Domain info container.
         * Represents Entity business. (Business logic).
         * Validates or gives the instructions how to validate (data, ...). Notice dataMapper(is a worker) validate things for own funtionality, Director does not validate those.
         * Gives permissions
         * Computes costs (memory ...)
         *
         * Not aware of Storage, SQL Database, Rest API, Text File, etc). Even those resources are get saved or retrieved.
         *
         * In a company organization context the tasks of a Director (role),
         * whom comminicates mostly with Managers, can be seen as domain object tasks.
         *
         * 2. Data Mappers, Repository `resources`
         * Parses storage data from (SQL, XML, file, ..) from and to resources.
         * For example Query execution is not a task of a Manager or Director. Query execution is the task of a Worker.
         * Mostly Manager requires a Worker from the Director (and the Director ModelMaps/...)
         * and Manager can comminicate directly (not via the Director per se) with the Woker.
         * For example $this->model("product")->finder("Foo");
         *
         * 3. Services, higher domain level objects `objects`
         * Allows access to the model layer.
         * Interacts Domain Objects and Mappers (descriptors)
         * Services are public to the Domain Object(s)/Business logic.
         *
         * Interacting with a model
         * Controller of the MVC should only comminicate trough Services.
         * Director provides a ServiceFactory here.
         * Director neither Worker know beforehand what kind of items they will be making.
         *
         * //I am not ok with this Factory thing yet.
         * The Factory Method design pattern can be applied where the Worker does not know beforehand which component should be called at runtime.
         * Factory within this (Director) context.
         * The Director maps to any Service. Which service can be defined in a map. So Mapping and Factory method solves the same problem?
         * When there is need for subclasses, the Mapping might get complex?
         * A class that builds via fluent interface actually a factory object?
         *
         *
         * //basic structure of model layer, is created by Director.
         * $serviceFactory = new ServiceFactory(
         *  new DataMapperFactory($pdo),
         *  new DomainObjectFactory
         * );
         * $serviceFactory->setDefaultNamespace('Application\\Service');
